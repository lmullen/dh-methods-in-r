# Worksheets

The best way to learn enough R to be able to use it for computational history is to practice. These worksheets contain a series of questions designed to teach you about R or about different computational methods. The worksheets are [R Markdown documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) that include text and code together. The places where you are expected to answer questions are marked like this. 

```
(@) Can you make a plot from this dataset?
```
Beneath each question is a space to either create a code block or write an answer.
